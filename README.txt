## My Boilerplate Send and withdrawüçù

I create a short boilerpalte that I use to study and also test something. I am at beginning! 
I think I am going to implement it.


It' a REMIX DEFAULT WORKSPACE! 

Remix default workspace is present when:
i. Remix loads for the very first time 
ii. A new workspace is created with 'Default' template
iii. There are no files existing in the File Explorer

This workspace contains 3 directories:

1. 'contracts': Holds three contracts with increasing levels of complexity.
2. 'scripts': Contains four typescript files to deploy a contract. It is explained below.
3. 'tests': Contains one Solidity test file for 'Ballot' contract & one JS test file for 'Storage' contract.
